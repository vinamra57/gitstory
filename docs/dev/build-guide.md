# How to Build
Running the command `uv build` will build the Python project.<br>

**Currently, the way to build + use this project is done by git-cloning this repo & running the commands in the local gitstory folder (see [setup-guide.md](setup-guide.md) for more details).** The GitStory team is currently trying to find a way to build this project that DOES NOT require users to git clone and be in the GitStory folder, aiming to reach this by Nov 12. (Written as of 11/08/2025).
