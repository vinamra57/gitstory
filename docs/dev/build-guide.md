# How to Build GitStory

## Step 1: Run `uv build`
In the CLI terminal (navigated to the GitStory directory), run:

```
uv build
```

## Step 2: 

## Step 3:

## Step 4: Use the GitStory build!

TO BE DELETED:
**Currently, the way to build + use this project is done by git-cloning this repo & running the commands in the local gitstory folder (see [setup-guide.md](setup-guide.md) for more details).** The GitStory team is currently trying to find a way to build this project that DOES NOT require users to git clone and be in the GitStory folder.
