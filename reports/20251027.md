## Individual Statuses

### Adwita Garg

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- By the end of Thursday 10/23, work with the backend team to start dividing up & coding the RepoParser (which also includes setting up libraries, codebase, folders, etc)
- By the end of Friday 10/24, discuss how our client-interface will look like with ShengYao (our UI developer) so the backend team can start implementing specific features (in this case, client commands) - starting with how the main “gitstory run” command will look like

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

- Divided up the tasks between the backend team and started coding individual parts, specifically I am working on trying to get the connections between components to work, ex: the connection between Repo Parser & LLM
- Discussed how the client-interface will look like collectively as a team
- Worked on the documentation for this week (specifically on the Implementation & Documentation part)

  
#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- By beginning of Thursday (before our TA meeting) 10/30, have a semi-working connector between Repo Parser & LLM (or just sending repos to LLM correctly in case if our Repo Parser doesn’t work correctly)
- By end of Saturday 11/1, have a working connection between the two components, and start testing Repo Parser-LLM connection and smoothen handling user commands, validating inputs, displaying outputs




### Derick Chiem

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Implement CI/CD using GitHub Actions (By end of 10/23/2025)
- Get a VERY basic console application functional (By end of 10/25/2025)
- Document testing requirements alongside team members (By end of 10/27/2025)

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

I have finished implementing the one-step testing and continuous integration, as well as documenting the setup for those tools. I have also added a basic CLI to be built on later. I have attempted to work on the git reading side of the program, but I faced difficulties in getting the GitPython library to work, and that is where I am currently stuck. I also have not been able to properly document the testing requirements.
  
#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Document testing requirements alongside team members (By end of 10/28/2025)
- Implement basic Git scanning functionality (By end of 10/31/2025)
- Make a prototype JSON unpacker for LLM data (by end of 11/02/2025)


### Ian Limasi 

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Practice on extracting around 10 commit histories from a mock/temporary Git repository (By end of 10/23/2025).
- Research more specifically about the GLM 4.5 model and practice prompting the AI API, to ensure I understand how to organize the commit histories for prompt optimality (By end of 10/26/2025).

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

- What I did: I followed tutorials on setting up GitPython and commit history extraction.
- What worked: I was able to extract 10 commit histories from a mock git repository
- What I learned: I learned that GitPython extracts data from the commit histories and turn them into a “Commit” object, whose fields represent the data collected.
- Where I had trouble: I had trouble following the written tutorial on setting up GitPython, so I resorted to video tutorials on YouTube. I also did not have the time to adequately research how to optimally prompt the GLM 4.5.
Where I am stuck: I’m not currently stuck anywhere.
  
#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Research more specifically about the GLM 4.5 model and practice prompting the AI API, to ensure I understand how to organize the commit histories for prompt optimality (By end of 10/30/2025).

### Vinamra Agarwal

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Work with the team to define and document the JSON data structures for summaries, metadata, and commit history that will be passed between components (By end of 10/23/2025)
- Continue refining the testing plan and research pytest implementation strategies specific to our CLI application (By end of 10/24/2025)
- Review alternative architectural decisions with the team, particularly around potential intermediary processors between the LLM and front-facing components (By end of 10/26/2025)
- Ensure all TA feedback items are fully addressed in the living document and coordinate final review with team members (By end of 10/27/2025)

### Vishal Sathambakkam

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Plan to work on a proof of concept this week, essentially enabling repo history feeding into our LLM. I’m sure this will prove to be useful moving forward as we are beginning our MVP development shortly. (By EOD 10/26)

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

- Currently working on the initial repository parsing pipeline to take a Git repository path and output clean, structured commit data ready for AI processing.

- Working in the /parser subdirectory of our project repository
  
#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Get a proof of concept out by the end of the week (ideally 10/31 EOD)

- Begin unit testing, branch/repo filtering across different sized repositories
