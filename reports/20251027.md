# Weekly Status Report: 10/20/25

## Team Report

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>
A decent amount of planning had been completed last week, and we are ready to move on to building our app with detailed initial setup instructions. While continuing to update our Living Document and Github repo, we aim to work on these things from now to the end of Friday 10/17/25:

- Adwita: Strengthen backend understanding by reviewing Python syntax and researching LLM–API integration to prepare for implementation.
- Derick: Finalize project architecture and design with the team; learn Python Click for CLI development; begin drafting testing requirements.
- Ian: Practice Python fundamentals and experiment with extracting commit histories from mock repositories; refine how commit data will be structured for the LLM.
- Vinamra: Continue refining documentation and testing plans; align MVP and stretch goals with feedback; ensure consistency across all sections of the living document.
- Vishal: Deepen understanding of how the LLM interfaces with the repo parser; validate architectural decisions and explore integration strategies for the CLI system.
- ShengYao: Create interactive mockup of front-end components on Figma; brainstorm how to turn everything into code.

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

We previously finished the software design section of the living document, so we spent the week mostly fleshing that out. We do have revisions for the software architecture section of the document from last week. There has also been significant progress on the software codebase, with the build system and testing frameworks being selected and implemented. There has also been acclimitization to developing in Python in general as well as the specifc tools and APIs that were are gonna use. Most of our team was busy this week, so we didn't quite as much progress as we would have liked, but progress is still going satisfactorily overall.
  
#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>
- Revise the software architecture section to correct mistakes (By end of 10/21/2025)
- Finalize the software architecture section (By end of 10/21/2025)
- Finish implementation of software development tools like the uv build system and GitHub Actions CI/CD (By end of 10/23/2025)
- Begin implementation of Git-related functionality to read data out of Git repositories for sending to LLM (By end of 10/26/2025)

## Individual Statuses

### Adwita Garg

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- By the end of Thursday 10/16, read up on the specific Python syntax we will be using (as it has been a while since I have coded in Python)
- By the end of Friday 10/17, research how our specific LLM will work with the Python code (i.e. how the API calls will work, how the backend code will work with the LLM, etc. as I don’t have much prior experience).


#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

This week, I worked on getting to know the Python syntax we will be using and researched how our specific LLM will work with the backend/Python code (so now I feel comfortable using specific Python libraries and know how our LLM works). I also worked on fixing the changes to our Living Document, due this Tuesday.
  
#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- By the end of Thursday 10/23, work with the backend team to start dividing up & coding the RepoParser (which also includes setting up libraries, codebase, folders, etc)
- By the end of Friday 10/24, discuss how our client-interface will look like with ShengYao (our UI developer) so the backend team can start implementing specific features (in this case, client commands) - starting with how the main “gitstory run” command will look like



### Derick Chiem

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Finalize project architecture and design with team members (By end of 10/14/2025)
- Familiarize myself with Python Click and it’s functionality (By end of 10/17/2025)
- Document testing requirements alongside team members (By end of 10/20/2025)

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

Since our team has this week’s documentation document mostly complete, I spent my time investigating and implementing development tools like build systems, testing, and linters. Currently, even though CI/CD implementation isn’t complete, we have a one-step build on my github branch.  
  
#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Implement CI/CD using GitHub Actions (By end of 10/23/2025)
- Get a VERY basic console application functional (By end of 10/25/2025)
- Document testing requirements alongside team members (By end of 10/27/2025)



### Ian Limasi 

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Learn syntax and 6 essential data structures in Python, including how it differs from programming languages I’m more familiar with  such as Java and TypeScript (By end of 10/16/2025).
- Practice on extracting around 10 commit histories from a mock/temporary Git repository (By end of 10/17/2025).
- Research or discuss more with my teammates regarding what information from the commits are necessary for the LLM and how to categorize/structure them optimally (By end of 10/17/2025).

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

- What I did: I learned the syntax and 6 essential data structures in Python, making sure to use my knowledge of other programming languages to learn faster. I also did research on what types of information are needed by an AI API.
- What worked: I was able to use Python comfortably while coding without needing constant syntax lookups. I was also able to successfully prompt an AI API and process its response.
- What I learned: I learned that having experience in other programming languages and data structures makes learning a new programming language much easier. I also learned that given a free plan for an AI API, rate limits could be a big issue when it comes to testing. So I learned to circumvent that with strategic and optimal testing.
- Where I had trouble: I did not have enough time to play around with extracting the commit history of a mock repository. Additionally, the AI API I practiced with was not the model we intend to use.
Where I am stuck: I’m not currently stuck anywhere.

  
#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Practice on extracting around 10 commit histories from a mock/temporary Git repository (By end of 10/23/2025).
- Research more specifically about the GLM 4.5 model and practice prompting the AI API, to ensure I understand how to organize the commit histories for prompt optimality (By end of 10/26/2025).



### Vinamra Agarwal

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Continue refining documentation and testing plans based on any additional feedback (By end of 10/16/2025)
- Ensure MVP and stretch goals remain aligned with team capabilities and TA expectations (By end of 10/17/2025)
- Review and verify consistency across all sections of the living document before submission (By 10/14/2025, 11:59 PM)
- Begin researching testing frameworks and strategies that will work best for our Python CLI application (By end of 10/17/2025)

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

- What I did: Implemented feedback from our TA project manager regarding the living document. Specifically, I revised the use cases section by updating triggers to reflect the actual actions that start processes rather than motivations, added the system as an actor where appropriate, and enhanced descriptions of how users interact with the visualization dashboard to clarify its features. I also reorganized the Software Architecture section by moving the diagram first and removing unnecessary commentary from the Organization section.
- What worked: The structural changes to the Software Architecture section made the document flow better and more logically. Simplifying the Organization section by removing redundant paragraphs improved clarity.
- What I learned: Triggers in use cases should focus on concrete actions rather than abstract motivations. This distinction makes use cases more precise and actionable.
- Where I had trouble: Balancing the level of detail needed to describe data structures (JSON formats for summaries, metadata, and commit history) without overcomplicating the architecture section.
- Where I am stuck: Not currently stuck anywhere, but need to coordinate with the team on defining the exact JSON schemas for data being passed between components.
  
#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Work with the team to define and document the JSON data structures for summaries, metadata, and commit history that will be passed between components (By end of 10/23/2025)
- Continue refining the testing plan and research pytest implementation strategies specific to our CLI application (By end of 10/24/2025)
- Review alternative architectural decisions with the team, particularly around potential intermediary processors between the LLM and front-facing components (By end of 10/26/2025)
- Ensure all TA feedback items are fully addressed in the living document and coordinate final review with team members (By end of 10/27/2025)


### Vishal Sathambakkam

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Further understand and read into how our intended LLM will interface with repo parser, as this is essentially the bootstrap of our CLI application (by 10/16)
- Work on an implementation concept of repo history “feeding” into an LLM to guide thinking for development moving forward (ideally by EOD 10/17)
- Help review and ensure a consistent living document (by 10/14)

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

- Currently in the process of learning more about how our LLM will interface with the repo parser.

- Revising a more clear cut approach to manage the flow of data between our different pieces of software architecture.

- Currently not stuck anywhere
  
#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Plan to work on a proof of concept this week, essentially enabling repo history feeding into our LLM. I’m sure this will prove to be useful moving forward as we are beginning our MVP development shortly. (By EOD 10/26)

### ShengYao Liu

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Create interactive mockup of command-line interface on Figma by Friday 10/17
- Create interactive mockup of visualization dashboard by Friday 10/17
- Review HTML/CSS/JavaScript syntax and style from Friday 10/17 to Tuesday 10/21 to better prepare myself for coding
Constantly update team goals and progress, adjust milestones schedule based on needs
- Big picture: for beyond next week, I will start writing code for front-end when others are ready to start coding, after Monday 10/20, since they’re still doing research and familiarizing themselves with our software architecture this week
