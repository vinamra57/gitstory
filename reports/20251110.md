# Weekly Status Report: 11/10/25

## Team Report

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>
(the person who was supposed to write it was sick unfortunately)
#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>
We were able to combine all the major parts of the application this week to create a united application. This left us in some technical debt with a lack of tests though, which we will work to rectify this week. Documentation also needs to be revised to meet the current implementation. 
#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>
- Reach our test coverage goals (by 11/13/2025)
- Update our documentation to match the current implementation of the program (by 11/16/2025)
- Improve API key input method (by 11/16/2025)
- Finish at least half of the remaining goals under the "Important" category in the living document (by 11/17/2025)
## Individual Statuses

### Adwita Garg

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- By beginning of Tuesday (11/04), obtain the Repo Parser, LLM & Visualization Dashboard code + integrate into the architecture; complete testing by end of tomorrow
- By Thursday (11/06) evening, discuss with team what features/edge cases we are missing and start assigning those between ourselves’


#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>
- Worked on resolving build/dev + user documentation, and added a Readme on how to make a Gemini API key
- Cleaned up my old branches on our git repo + did some more testing with different repos of different sizes, writing up any different behavior I saw (ex: empty response or incomplete response)
- Having some trouble but working on figuring out a smooth process for a clean build for the user


#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Resolve + have documentation showing how users can use/create a build by Wednesday, Nov 12
- Work on testing with different PCs + different Git repositories (i.e. moving on to our testing stage) by Thursday Nov 13 (once we have added some more formatting to Visualization Dashboard + cleaned up a couple of small things)

### Derick Chiem

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Redistribute goals so that Shengyao and I have actual goal (By the end of 11/04/2025)

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

This week, I implemented the build tools properly. I also did a tiny bit of documentation. I also started work on the “since” branch functionality, even though I didn’t finish it this week.

#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Finish the “Since” branch function (By end of 11/12/2025)
- Write proper tests for the functions without tests (By end of 11/15/2025)

### Ian Limasi 
  
#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Add more advanced CSS styling to the report including graphs and colors (By end of 11/6/2025).

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>
- What I did: I added CSS styling to the HTML elements, and made it so that the “Output” folder loads in the project root.
- What worked: All the HTML elements applied the correct CSS styling and became more readable
- What I learned: I learned that the generated HTML file needs to be able to locate where the CSS file is that I specified.
- Where I had trouble: When we generated the “Output” folder outside the GitStory project, the HTML report can no longer find the CSS file.
Where I am stuck: I’m not currently stuck anywhere.
#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>
- Generate the CSS file alongside the HTML report inside the “Output” folder (By end of 11/13/2025).
### Vinamra Agarwal

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Improve prompt engineering and fine-tune LLM outputs for accuracy and clarity (Estimated: 2 days).
- Add support for additional features in the LLM component, such as multi-query handling and adaptive context (Estimated: 3 days).
- Continue integration testing to ensure stability across modules after new updates (Estimated: 1.5 days).
- Coordinate with the parser and dashboard teams to validate full-system behavior in end-to-end runs (Estimated: 1 day)
