## Individual Statuses

### Adwita Garg

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- By beginning of Thursday (before our TA meeting) 10/30, have a semi-working connector between Repo Parser & LLM (or just sending repos to LLM correctly in case if our Repo Parser doesn’t work correctly)
- By end of Saturday 11/1, have a working connection between the two components, and start testing Repo Parser-LLM connection and smoothen handling user commands, validating inputs, displaying outputs

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>
- Worked on further implementing the software architecture in adgarg-architecture branch - merges Vinarma & Ian’s PR code, so that we didn’t have any merge conflicts/and takes into account how their components work
- Learned how to manage merge conflicts (a bit larger scale than what I am used to) and multiple PRs (as well as requesting code reviews)
- Currently running a bit behind as we need to put together the pieces and test with the whole group, planning on doing this tomorrow during our team meeting 

#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- By beginning of tomorrow, obtain the Repo Parser, LLM & Visualization Dashboard code + integrate into the architecture; complete testing by end of tomorrow
- By Thursday evening, discuss with team what features/edge cases we are missing and start assigning those between ourselves’

### Derick Chiem

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Document testing requirements alongside team members (By end of 10/28/2025)
- Implement basic Git scanning functionality (By end of 10/31/2025)
- Make a prototype JSON unpacker for LLM data (by end of 11/02/2025)

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

I was able to document the testing requirements, and I have spent time reviewing PRs and ensuring they meet our testing and file naming conventions. I have not been able to work on any coding though, as we split up the tasks in such a way that I have not been able to work on anything this week, which is a problem.

#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Redistribute goals so that Shengyao and I have actual goal (By the end of 11/04/2025)

### Ian Limasi 
  
#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Research more specifically about the GLM 4.5 model and practice prompting the AI API, to ensure I understand how to organize the commit histories for prompt optimality (By end of 10/30/2025).

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

- What I did: I ended up changing my goals entirely after we redistributed our tasks. I was tasked withe the visualization dashboard so I practiced taking in mock repo data (including commit histories), and turning those into a downloadable HTML report.
- What worked: I was able to successfully implement the ‘dashboard’ command.
- What I learned: I learned that the CI tests through GitHub Actions also need the dependencies I had in my code, which I had to provide in ‘pyproject.toml’.
- Where I had trouble: My implementation wasn’t working when merged with the other components, but I was able to solve it by simply fixing import statements after structural changes.
- Where I am stuck: I’m not currently stuck anywhere.

#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Add more advanced CSS styling to the report including graphs and colors (By end of 11/6/2025).

### Vinamra Agarwal

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Complete implementation of the LLM client with full retry logic and error handling (By end of 10/31/2025)
- Build out the prompt engineering module with templates for both CLI and dashboard output formats (By end of 11/01/2025)
- Implement response handler to process and format LLM outputs (By end of 11/02/2025)
- Create unit tests for all AI module components using pytest and mocked API responses (By end of 11/03/2025)
- Coordinate with Vishal to finalize data passing interface between parser and AI modules (By end of 11/01/2025)

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

- Completed the LLM client integration and ensured it successfully communicates with the overall system architecture.
- Conducted extensive testing to verify that all interfaces between the LLM, CLI, and repo parser work as expected.
- Collaborated closely with other developers to align data flow and confirm seamless component linkage across the system.
- Achieved all planned goals from last week.
- No major blockers, but additional optimization of the LLM responses is needed for better relevance and consistency.

#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Improve prompt engineering and fine-tune LLM outputs for accuracy and clarity (Estimated: 2 days).
- Add support for additional features in the LLM component, such as multi-query handling and adaptive context (Estimated: 3 days).
- Continue integration testing to ensure stability across modules after new updates (Estimated: 1.5 days).
- Coordinate with the parser and dashboard teams to validate full-system behavior in end-to-end runs (Estimated: 1 day).

### Vishal Sathambakkam

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Get a proof of concept out by the end of the week (ideally 10/31 EOD)

- Begin unit testing, branch/repo filtering across different sized repositories

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

- Worked on and pushed our initial repo parser implementation to our github repository. This takes care of commit metadata extraction, grouping and diff chunking as outlined in our MVP coding plan
- CLI integration tests work for the most part, and the current outputs match the AI module requirements (currently being worked on by other developers)
- Currently attempting to merge the architecture branch in my own to test on my end
  
#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Plan to begin writing unit tests for the parser to account for edge cases, such as empty or highly expansive repo sizes
- Coordinate with the AI developers to ensure a seamless integration and data flow as we’ve been discussing during our meetings
