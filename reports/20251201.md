## Individual Statuses

### Adwita Garg

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Create a plan for hallway testing on Tuesday or Thursday (when we meet up as a team) with new users and/or reach out to CS friends/mentors, asking them to use GitStory and ask how it works for them
- Discuss as a team + implement any feedback received from the Peer Review assignment (after this Tuesday, implement them by this Friday/or Monday if the issues or changes are major)
- 
#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

- Assigned issues + made an appropriate plan for the Gamma Release due Tuesday
- Worked with a couple of friends and asked them to test/run GitStory, overall feedback was positive, but both were Mac users, so need to get some Windows testers as well
- Working on hashing out the documentation issues from Peer Review + finalizing the build for GitStory, which is taking longer than expected (but this also because end of last week was dedicated towards studying for the 403 Midterm)
- No problems this week, but I didn’t make much progress this week with the midterm on Friday, so I am running a bit behind on my part (hoping to get more work done today, Monday Nov 24th)

#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Work on fixing up issues + features assigned to me (includes fixing some formatting on the CLI, documentation) by Monday night
- Work on the Build and email Hannah with issues I am running into by Wednesday night, at the latest, if I run into any issues tonight (24th)
- Work on testing with Windows users + discuss collectively for any remaining issues or features left to implement by Final Release (Dec 7) day (make a plan/assign tasks)

### Derick Chiem

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Finalize the “Since” and “Until” branch functions (By end of 11/18/2025)
- Upgrade the build system to use the uv build tool (By end of 11/24/2025)
- Rewrite user documentation to match current use of program (By end of 11/24/2025)

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

Since/until progress has been adopted by Vishal, as his implementation encompassed the progress I had made on that section and much more. I instead implemented CD (to the extent that I could; there are still some administrative actions that need to be done before it can be fully operational). I also added the new key saving system this week, which caused the documentation to be delayed since the documentation was reliant on that system and it’s specific implementation.

#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Rewrite user documentation to match current use of program (By end of 11/27/2025)
- Add Windows support to both documentation and code (if necessary) (By end of 11/30/2025)

### Ian Limasi 
  
#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Implement the UI design for the graphs and other visualizations (By end of 11/20/2025).

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

- What I did: I updated my goal as the UI design and visualization task was handed over to ShengYao. Instead, I fixed the issues brought up by our peer reviewers regarding the dashboard’s tests.
- What worked: I was able to update the tests to reflect the new behavior of the dashboard, and generalized it to work for both mac and windows.
- What I learned: I learned that path routing structures are not universal across different operating systems.
- Where I had trouble: I did not experience any troubles.
- Where I am stuck: I’m not currently stuck anywhere.

#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>
- Integrate ShengYao’s visualizations with the dashboard (By end of 11/27/2025).

### Vinamra Agarwal

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Test different components and newly added features for stability and functionality (by end of 11/19/2025 - 2 days)
- Review and improve documentation to reflect current implementation (by end of 11/20/2025 - 2 days)
- Collect and organize feedback from peer review assignment and TA project manager Hannah (by 11/19/2025 - 1 day)
- Implement feedback from peer review and TA, prioritizing critical issues first (by end of 11/22/2025 - 3 days)
- Identify and fix bugs discovered during component testing (ongoing through 11/22/2025)


#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

- Closed two issues identified during peer review process
- Created and submitted PR addressing peer review feedback
- Implemented and submitted PR for compare branch feature in dashboard
- Completed testing of newly added features and components
- Successfully collected and organized feedback from both peer review assignment and TA Hannah

#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Prepare GitStory for gamma release by finalizing remaining bug fixes (by end of 11/26/2025 - 2 days)
- Improve developer workflow documentation with setup instructions and contribution guidelines (by end of 11/27/2025 - 2 days)
- Enhance user workflow by creating comprehensive usage examples and troubleshooting guide (by end of 11/29/2025 - 3 days)
- Test gamma release features for stability before final submission (by end of 11/29/2025 - 1 day)

### Vishal Sathambakkam

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Based off of TA feedback, I hope to perform a comprehensive code review of the repo parser implementation and fix any outstanding bugs (EOD 11/12)

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

- Worked on and pushed our initial repo parser implementation to our github repository. This takes care of commit metadata extraction, grouping and diff chunking as outlined in our MVP coding plan
- CLI integration tests work for the most part, and the current outputs match the AI module requirements (currently being worked on by other developers)
- Currently working on the “since” CLI functionality, revising how the current branch system works/where summary generation is occurring
- Reviewing GIT PRs by other developers to ensure LLM responses are more fact-dense, actionable and account for hierarchical error resolution

#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Plan to review and plan a development workflow to integrate the “since” feature, and allow for seamless interfacing with the AI module 
- Further coordinate with AI developers to ensure consistency regarding CLI outputs
- Further unit test the repo parser during the development process (EOD 11/19)
