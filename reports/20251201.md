## Individual Statuses

### Adwita Garg

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Work on fixing up issues + features assigned to me (includes fixing some formatting on the CLI, documentation) by Monday night
- Work on the Build and email Hannah with issues I am running into by Wednesday night, at the latest, if I run into any issues tonight (24th)
- Work on testing with Windows users + discuss collectively for any remaining issues or features left to implement by Final Release (Dec 7) day (make a plan/assign tasks)
- 
#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

- Worked on the Gamma Release with team members (including slides for presentation) and finished by Tuesday night; Gamma release product meets all requirements, we still need to add visuals and graphs to the Visualization Dashboard (Ian & ShengYao’s tasks)
- Pushed code with Derick and got the GitStory build to work - i.e. it doesn’t require users to now work with the ‘git clone’ version of getting GitStory to work
- Developed a small list of tasks that are remaining so we are all organized/know what’s left as a team


#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Update the documentation for builds for users + dev to now disinclude the ‘uv build’/i.e now they can just do pipx install gitstory to get GitStory on their PC (do by Tuesday night)
- Work with Derick to publish the release on GitStory (i.e. the build that PyPI has on Git, so everyone can access it)
- Develop further tests for GitStory and clean up code (if need be), do by Thursday night
- Work on updating our Living Document for final submission (do by Friday night) + our Final Presentation slides (which are due Sunday night)
- Push any final touches to GitStory or help others on other tasks if they need help (which we will figure out when we do a debrief tomorrow as a team)

### Ian Limasi 
  
#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Integrate ShengYao’s visualizations with the dashboard (By end of 11/27/2025).

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

- What I did: I integrated mock visualizations into the dashboard which includes a pie and bar chart of contributions
- What worked: The visualizations stayed consistent and reflected the data appropriately
- What I learned: I learned that without JavaScript, the amount of interaction I can do with the dashboard is very limited.
- Where I had trouble: I did not experience any troubles.
- Where I am stuck: I’m not currently stuck anywhere.

#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>
- Replace the mock visualizations with ShengYao’s visualizations with the dashboard (By end of 12/4/2025).
