# Weekly Status Report: 11/10/25

## Team Report

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>
- Reach our test coverage goals (by 11/13/2025)
- Update our documentation to match the current implementation of the program (by 11/16/2025)
- Improve API key input method (by 11/16/2025)

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>
This week we made large progress in “paying back” our technical debt, adding in tests and reforming necessary functionality to make it easier to be used by end users. We also extended some of the functionality we added last week with more features, and started work on the couple final features that we outlined in our architecture. This week we also started work on continuously deploying the project to Github using Github actions, and we also started updating our old documentation to match the current program state.
#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>
- Review and act on advice given to us though the peer review process (By end of 11/24/2025)
- Update our user manual to the current state of our program (By end of 11/20/2025)
- Finalize the continuous deployment processes of Gitstory (by end of 11/24/2025)
## Individual Statuses

### Adwita Garg

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Resolve + have documentation showing how users can use/create a build by Wednesday, Nov 12
- Work on testing with different PCs + different Git repositories (i.e. moving on to our testing stage) by Thursday Nov 13 (once we have added some more formatting to Visualization Dashboard + cleaned up a couple of small things)

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

- Worked on “documentation TLC,” almost close to creating a PR +  will have it pushed sometime soon once its reviewed (by the end of today)
- Found an article that will help in creating a clean build for GitStory that will work for users + will be a clean build, and will add that as part of the build instructions for GitStory
- I might need to ask Hannah and verify that the build works and is correct (in terms of what is expected for a build).
- Tested GitStory with some of my own repos that I know/use + found good success rate overall

#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Create a plan for hallway testing on Tuesday or Thursday (when we meet up as a team) with new users and/or reach out to CS friends/mentors, asking them to use GitStory and ask how it works for them
- Discuss as a team + implement any feedback received from the Peer Review assignment (after this Tuesday, implement them by this Friday/or Monday if the issues or changes are major)

### Derick Chiem

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Finish the “Since” branch function (By end of 11/12/2025)
- Write proper tests for the functions without tests (By end of 11/15/2025)

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

The “since” branch functionality was mostly completed this week, alongside the “until” branch functionality. I couldn’t test it though, as I ran into problems that got patched later in the main branch and had to be combined with my branch before I could properly test the functionality.
I also removed the .env file that was used to load the API key before and replaced it with a .txt file, accessed by command, for ease-of-use reasons.

#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Finalize the “Since” and “Until” branch functions (By end of 11/18/2025)
- Upgrade the build system to use the uv build tool (By end of 11/24/2025)
- Rewrite user documentation to match current use of program (By end of 11/24/2025)

### Ian Limasi 
  
#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Generate the CSS file alongside the HTML report inside the “Output” folder (By end of 11/13/2025).

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

- What I did: I was able to generate the CSS file with the HTML file in the output folder.
- What worked: The CSS file now generates within the output folder alongside the HTML file
- What I learned: I learned that generating the CSS file alongside the HTML file which depends on it is much more scalable and convenient for the users.
- Where I had trouble: I did not experience any troubles.
- Where I am stuck: I’m not currently stuck anywhere.

#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>
- Implement the UI design for the graphs and other visualizations (By end of 11/20/2025).

### Vinamra Agarwal

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Implement error handling for empty JSON responses from LLM - either display clear error messages to users or implement automatic retry logic (By 11/13/2025)
- Add end character validation to prevent incomplete LLM responses from being processed (By 11/14/2025)
- Improve guardrails and prompt engineering to enhance the quality and reliability of LLM responses (By 11/16/2025)
- Continue writing and expanding test coverage for LLM component (By 11/16/2025)

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

- Test different components and newly added features for stability and functionality (by end of 11/19/2025 - 2 days)
- Review and improve documentation to reflect current implementation (by end of 11/20/2025 - 2 days)
- Collect and organize feedback from peer review assignment and TA project manager Hannah (by 11/19/2025 - 1 day)
- Implement feedback from peer review and TA, prioritizing critical issues first (by end of 11/22/2025 - 3 days)
- Identify and fix bugs discovered during component testing (ongoing through 11/22/2025)

### Vishal Sathambakkam

#### <u>Last Week's Goals</u>

- Based off of TA feedback, I hope to perform a comprehensive code review of the repo parser implementation and fix any outstanding bugs (EOD 11/12)

#### <u>Progress and Issues</u>

- Worked on and pushed our initial repo parser implementation to our github repository. This takes care of commit metadata extraction, grouping and diff chunking as outlined in our MVP coding plan
- CLI integration tests work for the most part, and the current outputs match the AI module requirements (currently being worked on by other developers)
- Currently working on the “since” CLI functionality, revising how the current branch system works/where summary generation is occurring
- Reviewing GIT PRs by other developers to ensure LLM responses are more fact-dense, actionable and account for hierarchical error resolution

#### <u>Plans and goals for next week</u>

- Plan to review and plan a development workflow to integrate the “since” feature, and allow for seamless interfacing with the AI module 
- Further coordinate with AI developers to ensure consistency regarding CLI outputs
- Further unit test the repo parser during the development process (EOD 11/19)
